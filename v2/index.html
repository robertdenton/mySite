If you're looking at this, you may be wondering why (and how) my standard and mobile sites are different in content. The reason is, the user experience on a desktop/laptop is very diferent than on a tablet or smart phone. Larger screens are more, let's say, official. You use them while working, checking email and maybe even gaming. Everything you do on a desktop or laptop has a very specific purpose.

Mobile, on the other hand is much more social. (For the purposes of this I'm going to call tablet and mobile just mobile, although they have important differences also.) Mobile is used to communicate and is much more friendly. Most importantly, your tolerance for bullshit is much lower on mobile. So while my desktop site is used as a personal branding tool, my mobile site is no nonsense. I keep it brief and on point. I don't try and use big words to impress or shiny graphics. I just have Helvetica and a little about myself. You want the good information and you want it now. Because you could be texting your friend back on mobile but instead I want you looking at my site.

This idea mirrors my efforts to keep the code for mobile extremely light and flexible, no matter the screen size or bandwith. My mobile site contains no heavy visuals and loads quickly while my desktop version is bandwith heavy with several images and scripts. That's because if you're on a desktop or laptop and looking at my website, chances are your have a pretty reliable connection and a screen large enough to appreciate the visuals. On mobile the gifs would load slowly and would have much less of an effect.

So there you go, my rationale behind the differences between desktop and mobile. If you're reading this, I hope you see that I didn't just put some pretty graphics in to try and woo you. I'm thoughtful about everything I code, but I can make those pretty visuals when the story calls for it.

				<p> Over the past four years I have acted as a photojournalist, videographer, web developer, IT manager and editor-in-chief of the <a href="http://www.cuindependent.com">CU Independent</a>. Over that time I was proud to build a new website and brand for the CUI.</p>
				<p>I have also had the privilege to do a number of fantastic internships. For two summers I worked with former National Geographic Director of Photography Rich Clarkson at <a href="http://www.clarkson-creative.com/">Clarkson Creative</a>. I started at the small multimedia firm straight out of high school and learned very quickly about the business of journalism and how photojournalists work. I spent one summer learning about community journalism at <a href="http://www.greeleytribune.com">The Greeley Tribune</a>, where I gained a great respect for deadlines. More recently, I was honored to be chosen as one of 15 college journalists from around the country to participate in the first ever PBS News Hour <a href="http://www.inaugblog.com">InaugBlog</a>. And last summer I spent 10 weeks in Washington D.C. with the <a href="http://www.shfwire.com">Scripps Howard Foundation Wire</a> producing national multimedia pieces. At Scripps I got my first taste of data journalism and learned the importance of good formatting.</p>
				<p>In May I plan on graduating from the University of Colorado with a Bachelor of Science in journalism, a minor in Technology, Arts & Media, an advertising certificate and strong interest in business. I've taken computer science courses including one on iOS app development, business courses in marketing and entrepreneurialism and of course traditional journalism courses in ethics and legal principles.</p>
				<p>After graduation I hope to join a forward-thinking newsroom where I can tell important stories.

				<p>I am a digital storyteller with a soft spot for print. That said, I would much rather produce content for the Web where space is limitless and you can use many more tools.</p>
				<p>In my opinion, photos, video, data and web widgets have been vastly underutilized on the Net. This should not draw away from the importance of text; words are still the most efficient way to communicate complicated information. But, there are other methods to tell stories.</p>
				<p>I am a firm believer in <a href="http://transmediajournalism.org/">transmedia journalism</a> and investigating new revenue models for our business.</p>

			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>I'm a <b>visual storyteller</b>. Because what is journalism if not storytelling?</p>
			<p>I think that photos, video, data viz and web widgets have been vastly underutilized on the Net. I want to fix that. This is not to draw away from the importance of text, words are still the most efficient way to communicate complicated information. But, there are other methods to tell stories.</p>
			<p>I'm a firm believer in transmedia journalism and investigating new revenue models for our business.</p>
			<p>And I want to <b>disrupt</b>. Because change is good. It may not be comfortable, but if you embrace it, if you truly throw your weight into the winds of change, there's no telling what we can accomplish.</p>
