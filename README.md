This is my evolution of personal websites, post my first Wordpress blog which is still live at <a href="http://robertrdenton.wordpress.com">robertrdenton.wordpress.com</a> if you want to see my ramblings.

The first site was Skrollr heavy and didn't have a mobile site.
The second site wasn't designed as well as I would have liked it but it's still active at <a href="http://www.robertrdenton.com">robertrdenton.com</a>.
The third site will hopefully be launched by early March and will be light and well designed.
