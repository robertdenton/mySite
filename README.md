This is my evolution of personal websites, post my first Wordpress blog which is still live at <a href="http://robertrdenton.wordpress.com">robertrdenton.wordpress.com</a> if you want to see my ramblings.

1 - The first site was Skrollr heavy and didn't have a mobile site.

2 - The second site wasn't designed as well as I would have liked so I started from scratch..

3 - The third site was launched 2/17/14 at <a href="http://www.robertrdenton.com">robertrdenton.com</a>. It's somewhat lighter (no jquery needed) and tells my story. I'm a visual storyteller after all so I'd better be able to tell my own story visually.
